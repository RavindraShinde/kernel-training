/boot/ directory holds files used in booting the operating system depending on the boot loader, most commonly (on Linux) LILO or GRUB.

Linux
vmlinux – the Linux kernel[2]
initrd.img – a temporary file system, used prior to loading the kernel[3]
System.map – a symbol lookup table[4]

/boot/ is often simply a directory on the main (or only) hard drive partition. However, it may be a separate partition. A separate 
partition is generally only used when bootloaders are incapable of reading the main filesystem (e.g. SILO does not recognize XFS) or 
other problems not easily resolvable by users.
