/dev/loop* are loop devices making plain files accessible as block devices. They are typically used for mounting 
disk images.

In Unix-like operating systems, a loop device, vnd (vnode disk), or lofi (loop file interface) is a pseudo-device 
that makes a computer file accessible as a block device.

Files of this kind are often used for CD ISO images and floppy disk images. Mounting a file containing a file 
system via such a loop mount makes the files within that file system accessible.

After mounting a file that holds a file system, the files in that system can be accessed through the usual file 
system interface of the operating system, without any need for special functionality, such as reading and writing 
to ISO images, in applications.

The device is called a "loop" device and device nodes are usually named /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1, etc. They can be 
created with makedev for the static device directory, dynamically by the facilities of the device file system 
(udev), or directly with mknod.
