https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)

dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems, the primary purpose of which is to convert and copy files.

On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disk drives) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) 
appear in the file system just like normal files; dd can also read and/or write from/to these files, provided that function is 
implemented in their respective driver. As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, 
and obtaining a fixed amount of random data. The dd program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including 
byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.

DD Command will block devices.
